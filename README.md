# Slack Meeting Summarizer Bot

This project is an end-to-end Slack bot that summarizes meeting transcriptions stored on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
It uses Terraform for infrastructure setup, serverless event-driven architectures, and integrates vector search for semantic retrieval.

## Features

- üåê Infrastructure as Code with **Terraform** on **GCP**
- üìÇ **Upload** meeting transcription files to **GCS Bucket**
- üîî **Pub/Sub** event triggers ingestion pipeline
- üß† **Vector Database** (**Qdrant**) for semantic search and filtering
- ‚ö° **Indexed** metadata fields in Qdrant for faster queries
- üöÄ **FastAPI** app served via **Cloud Run** as Slack Webhook
- üßπ **Redis** for deduplication of events
- üìù **Langfuse** to trace and monitor LLM requests
- ü§ñ **OpenAI** models for embeddings and question-answering

## Architecture Overview

1. **User uploads** a meeting transcription file to a **GCS Bucket**.
2. **Pub/Sub** detects the file upload and **triggers** a **Cloud Function**.
3. **Cloud Function** ingests the document and metadata into **Qdrant**.
4. A **FastAPI** app is deployed on **Cloud Run** to interact with **Slack API**:
   - Users mention the Slack bot to ask questions about past meetings.
   - Queries are semantically matched against vectorized meeting data.
5. **Langfuse** tracks and monitors requests for observability.
6. **Redis** ensures event deduplication for reliability.

## How It Works

1. **Upload a Meeting Transcription**
   - The user uploads a transcription file (e.g., `.docx`) into a **Google Cloud Storage** bucket.

2. **Trigger via Pub/Sub**
   - A **Pub/Sub** topic is configured to listen to new file uploads.
   - When a file is uploaded, an event is published.

3. **Ingest Document**
   - A **Cloud Function** is triggered by the Pub/Sub event.
   - The function reads the uploaded file, extracts metadata, generates embeddings using **OpenAI**, and stores the document in **Qdrant** (vector store).
   - Metadata fields are **indexed** to speed up future filtering during search.

4. **Ask Questions via Slack**
   - A **FastAPI** app, deployed on **Cloud Run**, is connected to a **Slack App** via Webhooks.
   - In Slack, users can **mention** the bot and ask questions about the meetings.
   - The app retrieves relevant meeting chunks from **Qdrant** and uses **OpenAI** to generate a summarized answer.

5. **Trace and Monitor**
   - All interactions are traced through **Langfuse** for monitoring, observability, and debugging.
   - **Redis** ensures deduplication of Pub/Sub events to prevent double-processing.
